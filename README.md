# Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience in web development. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is designed to provide an overview of my work and abilities to potential employers or clients.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Static page links**: The website has links to navigate to specific parts, as well as a button to return to the top.
- **CSS Animations:** This webpage has some moving components, like the social icons. I made this moving components in order to experiment with simple animations in CSS3.
